##Purpose  
The purpose of this project was to analyze a citibike share program in New York for the month of August in 2019. Using Tableau, I created visualizations that show:

How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.
